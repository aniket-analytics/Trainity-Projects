## 🔍 Marketing Use Cases & Queries

### 📌 Q1: Find the 5 oldest (most loyal) users

```sql
SELECT username, created_at
FROM ig_clone.users
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 5;
```

### 📌 Q2: Find users who have never posted a photo

```sql
SELECT u.username
FROM ig_clone.users u
LEFT JOIN ig_clone.photos p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE p.user_id IS NULL
ORDER BY u.username;
```

### 📌 Q3: Identify contest winner (most likes on a single photo)

```sql
SELECT username
FROM (
  SELECT likes.photo_id, users.username, COUNT(likes.user_id) AS like_user
  FROM ig_clone.likes
  INNER JOIN ig_clone.photos ON likes.photo_id = photos.id
  INNER JOIN ig_clone.users ON photos.user_id = users.id
  GROUP BY likes.photo_id, users.username
  ORDER BY like_user DESC
  LIMIT 1
) base;
```

### 📌 Q4: Top 5 most used hashtags

```sql
SELECT t.tag_name, COUNT(p.photo_id) AS num_tags
FROM ig_clone.photo_tags p
INNER JOIN ig_clone.tags t ON p.tag_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.tag_name
ORDER BY num_tags DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 📌 Q5: Find best day of the week to launch ad campaigns

```sql
SELECT WEEKDAY(created_at) AS weekday, COUNT(username) AS num_users
FROM ig_clone.users
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

> Days: 0 = Monday, ..., 6 = Sunday

## 📈 Investor Metrics & Queries

### 📌 Q1: Provide how many times does average user posts on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram/total number of users

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT u.id AS userid, COUNT(p.id) AS photoid
  FROM ig_clone.users u
  LEFT JOIN ig_clone.photos p ON u.id = p.user_id
  GROUP BY u.id
)
SELECT 
  SUM(photoid) AS total_photos,
  COUNT(userid) AS total_users,
  SUM(photoid)/COUNT(userid) AS photo_per_user
FROM CTE;
```

### 📌 Q2: Detect possible bot accounts (users who liked all photos)

```sql
WITH photo_count AS (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(photo_id) AS num_like
  FROM ig_clone.likes
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT * 
FROM photo_count
WHERE num_like = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ig_clone.photos);
```

## 📊 Findings

* **Loyal Users**: The oldest users are early adopters, useful for loyalty campaigns.
* **Inactive Users**: Several users have never posted, which can be targeted via reminders.
* **Engagement Leader**: Contest winners can be identified based on like count per photo.
* **Hashtag Strategy**: Top 5 hashtags provide direction for better content reach.
* **Ad Timing**: Most user registrations happen on a specific day of the week—ideal for campaign launches.
* **Platform Activity**: Healthy average post count per user; useful metric for investors.
* **Bot Detection**: SQL can help identify suspicious user patterns like liking every photo.

## 📝 Reports

* **User Report**: Oldest users, inactive users, and top contest winner.
* **Hashtag Report**: Top-performing hashtags.
* **Ad Campaign Report**: Best day to launch ads based on user registration trends.
* **Engagement Report**: Average posts per user, total photos, and bot detection.
